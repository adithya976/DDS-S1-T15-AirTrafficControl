## Abstract

> This project focuses on developing a Real-Time Air Traffic Control system utilizing digital logic gates to automate key tasks performed by airport control towers. Air traffic control (ATC) is critical for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of airports, where numerous tasks like managing landings, take-offs, and emergencies are traditionally handled by humans. However, human intervention is prone to errors. To address this, we present a fully automated Real-Time Air Traffic Control system, which performs all essential tasks such as runway clearance, weather sensing, terminal and gate chooser and emergency management without manual input. It replaces manual operations with a fully automated process.

> The motivation for this project arises from the need to reduce human intervention in ATC processes and minimize the possibility of human error, particularly in critical situations like emergency landings and many more. By leveraging digital circuits, the system ensures faster, more accurate decision-making in real-time, thereby enhancing both safety and operational efficiency. In an environment where even minor delays or mistakes can have serious consequences, automating such processes can significantly improve airport management, especially when multiple variables like weather conditions, runway availability, and aircraft fuel status must be considered simultaneously.

> Our contribution lies in developing an automated ATC system that receives data from aircraft sensors—range, speed, altitude, and fuel level—as well as weather sensors. A majority voting circuit is incorporated to reduce errors in the sensor inputs, ensuring accurate and reliable data processing. We have integrated a RADAR detection feature, which monitors incoming planes approaching the airport for landing. One of the unique features of this project includes automatic emergency management feature. When an aircraft’s fuel level is critically low or if it has any damage, the system designates it as an emergency, prioritizes its landing, and dispatches ground vehicles to assist. If an aircraft’s fuel is too high, the system prevents it from landing until the fuel level reaches a safe threshold, avoiding potential risks. The system handles emergencies, prioritizes aircraft based on fuel status and other features, and improves the overall safety and reliability of airport operations through a fully automated process.
